# Minecraft Server Plugins

This Project includes multiple Minecraft Server Plugins to run on your Server.

I tried to seperate the different Functions into different Plugins to make it a build yourself kind of Project.


## Features

- AdminTools
    - ServerUptime (/uptime)
    - List Active Worlds (/worldlist)
- Jump and Run (Still in development, still lot of config hardcodet) (/jumpnrun [easy,medium,hard])
    - Iron Pressure Plate as Checkpoint
    - Gold Pressure Plate as Finish
    - Oak Pressure Plate as Reset
- Knockback Gamemode
    - Gives the Player a Knockback Stick
    - Disabled Item Drop
    - Disabled Damage Taken
    - Dropoff Platform = Reset to Spawn



## Issues

There are still loads of Issues, I am still working on the things.
Currently you can barely configure things without recompiling the java file.
